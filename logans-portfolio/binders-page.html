    <h1> How its created </h1>
             <p>
                All deisgns are hand drawn by me Using procreate on the ipade air.
                Most designs average around 9 to 10 hours of work, with some taking up to 15 hours to complete.
                and thats just the drawing process, once the drawing is finished to the point of satisfaction, the 
                design is exported and then taken to photoshop where the design gets text applied then exported as a png.
                After the design is exported from photoshop it then gets cut out and ironed onto the binder using a heat press, the heat press is used to ensure the design is properly adhered to the binder and wont come off easily.

             <h1> How it started  </h1>
             <p>
                The idea for customising binders stemmed from a few inspirations.

                First inspiration came from seeing the pokemon companies official
                gengar and charizard binder the binders where etched with the charcaters 
                and had the color to match the pokemon.
                This made me want to purchace the binders but what was avaiable wouldnt
                fit the cards owned by me due to all my cards being safley toploaded which made 
                them to big for the binders sold by the pokemon company.
                So i decided to create my own custom binders knowing that it'll fit my cards
                while also being able to design it to my liking.
                The second inspiration came from seeing other artists on social media paint items to 
                customise them to their liking.
                This drove more insiration to create somethig that shows off my artistic skills
                while also helping me stand out in the trading card community, and help 
                differentiate binders from one another so that when someone looks at 
                the cover they can instantly recognize it was mine and the contents inside.

                    <p>
                        Mr. truecrawler is a person i met through a 
                        mutual friend, he collects pokemon cards as a hobby 
                        he saw my social media posts about the binders and messaged me 
                        asking if i could make him a binder with his username on it, and a design that he liked.
                        I agreed to make him a binder and we discussed the design he wanted, and a price for the binder, 
                        after we agreed on the design and price i got to work on the binder. 
                        The design was finished in a few days, once the binder was finished i shipped it to him and he was very happy with the final product.
