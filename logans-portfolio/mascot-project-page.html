                <p>
                    The goal of this project was to create a mascot for a fictional sports team of my choice.
                    I decided baseball would be a good sport to create a mascot for, and I wanted to create a mascot that was fun and playful, but also had a strong 
                    different from the typical mascots that you see in sports.
                </p>

             <h1> Ideation </h1>
             <p>
                The ideation process for this project was a lot of fun. I had a lot of ideas for the mascot,
                but I wanted to make sure that it was something that was unique and stood out something different from everyone else.
                I also wanted to make sure that it was something that would appeal to a wide audience. I ended up going with a duck because I thought it was a 
                fun and playful animal that would be easy to recognize.
                I also wanted to make sure that the duck had a strong and muscular appearance, 
                which is why I gave it a muscle physique.

                    <p>
                        In the end the mascot name and overall design and feel of 
                        the mascot turned out very similar to what I had originally envisioned.
                        he looks fun and playful, but also strong and powerful.
