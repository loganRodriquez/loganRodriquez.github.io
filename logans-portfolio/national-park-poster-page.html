              <h1> problem </h1>
             <p>
                The reason the orgininal park poster was redesiigned was due to 
                the lack of visual hierarchy and the overwhelming amount of negative space on the right side of the 
                poster. The text was also in a position where reading it make it awakward
                and took away from the overall aesthetic of the poster.
                Another reason for the redesign was how much left alighed the 
                overall poster was making it feel unbalanced.
             </p>
             <h1> solution </h1>
             <p>
                The solution to the problems stated above was to create a better 
                visual hierarchy making sure the silhouette of the bear was centered and took up most 
                of the poster space. Another detail i wanted to try to add was making the animals 
                as added details 
             </p>
             <h1> ideation </h1>
             <p>
                Most of my ideation came from my reaserch images. When 
                coming up with  ideas for the redesign I wanted to try to keep 
                the orgininal feel just with a better heirarchy and text placement 

             </p>

                    <p>
                    After completing the redesign of the national park poster,
                    the new designs has a much better way of showing the visual
                    hierarchy and over all balance with the colors and text placement.
                    The new design also keeps the original feel of the poster while
                    improving on the problems the orgininal design had.
