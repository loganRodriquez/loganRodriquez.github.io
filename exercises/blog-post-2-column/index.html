                Vegeta (ベジータ Bejīta), more specifically Vegeta IV 
                (ベジータ四世 Bejīta Yonsei),[1] recognized as Prince Vegeta 
                (ベジータ王子 Bejīta Ōji), is the prince of the fallen Saiyan 
                race and the husband of Bulma, the father of Trunks and Bulla, 
                the eldest son of King Vegeta, as well as one of the
                main characters 
                of the Dragon Ball series.

            <h2> character development </h2>
            <p>
                Vegeta's strong character development has received high praise
                and is regarded as the biggest in the series. He initially
                debuted as the main antagonist of the Vegeta Saga
                but progressed into a more anti-heroic tritagonist role
                for the rest of Dragon Ball Z. Since the Majin Buu Saga and
                going into Dragon Ball Super, Vegeta has been the main 
                deuteragonist/secondary protagonist behind Goku.

            <h2> vegetas growth </h2>
            <p>
                Over the course of the series, Vegeta's 
                physical appearance changes. While originally appearing 
                very short and lean, especially compared to his massive 
                partner, Nappa, he later seems to be somewhat taller 
                and noticeably more muscular. His hair becomes 
                shorter and his forehead becomes smaller 
                and his facial features, which are perpetually 
                in a scowl (in contrast to before he lost his first 
                fight with Goku, when he smiled most of the time), 
                also look more distinct and sharply defined as the 
                series progresses, making him look much older in later 
                sagas compared to what he looked like in his debut.
