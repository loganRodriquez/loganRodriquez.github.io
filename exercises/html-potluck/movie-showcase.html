            </h3>
            <p>
                Peter Parker (Garfield) is an outcast high schooler 
                who was abandoned by his parents as a boy, leaving 
                him to be raised by his Uncle Ben (Sheen) and 
                Aunt May (Field). Like most teenagers, 
                Peter is trying to figure out who he is 
                and how he got to be the person he is today.
                Peter is also finding his way with his first 
                high school crush, Gwen Stacy (Stone), and together,
                they struggle with love, commitment,
                and secrets. As Peter discovers 
                a mysterious briefcase that belonged 
                to his father, he begins a quest 
                to understand his parents' disappearance 
                - leading him directly to Oscorp and the
                lab of Dr. Curt Connors (Ifans), his 
                father's former partner.

            <p>
                The Lord of the Rings is an epic[1] high fantasy novel[a]
                written by the English author and scholar J. R. R. 
                Tolkien. Set in Middle-earth, the story began as a 
                equel to Tolkien's 1937 children's book The Hobbit
                but eventually developed into a much larger work. 
                Written in stages between 1937 and 1949, The Lord 
                of the Rings is one of the best-selling books ever 
                written, with over 150 million copies sold.[2]
