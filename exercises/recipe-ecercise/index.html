            These pizza rolls are a homemade copycat of the ones I 
            grew up eating. My mom always had a batch ready for school 
            lunches or after-school snacks. They’re like a better, fresher 
            version of Totino’s, with piping hot, gooey cheese that oozes 
            out the moment you take a bite.

            <li>
                1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
            </li>
            <li>
                1/4 cup grated parmesan
            </li>
            <li>
                1 tablespoon chopped basil
            </li>
            <li>
                1 tablespoon chopped parsley
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p> 
            FOR ASSEMBLY
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                25 wonton wrappers
            </li>
            <li>
                vegetable oil, for frying
            </li>
            <h2>
                Instructions
            </h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Make the filling: In a bowl, mix together the shredded 
                    mozzarella, 
                    pizza sauce, 
                    chopped turkey pepperoni, red pepper flakes, oregano, 
                    parmesan, 
                    basil, and parsley until everything is well combined. 
                    Set aside.             
                </li>
                <li>
                   Stuff and assemble: Have a small bowl of water ready for 
                    sealing. Lay out the wonton wrappers in a diamond shape so the 
                    corners point up, down, left, and right.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Spoon a small dollop of filling (about 1 to 1 ½ teaspoons) 
                   into the center of each wrapper.
             </li>
                    <li>
                    Dip your finger in water and run it along all the edges of the wrapper.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                 Fold the bottom corner up over the filling to form a triangle.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Fold in the left and right corners toward the center.
                 <li>
                    Then fold the top corner down and press to seal everything 
                    shut like an envelope. Make sure all the edges are tightly sealed 
                    so no filling leaks out.
                </li>
                <li>
                   Heat vegetable oil in a deep pan to 350°F (175°C). Once hot, 
                 carefully add the rolls in batches and fry until golden brown and
                 crispy on all sides, about 2 to 3 minutes. Remove and place on
                 a paper towel–lined plate to drain any excess oil.
                </li>
                <li>
                 Serve hot with extra pizza sauce or ranch for dipping!
                </li>
